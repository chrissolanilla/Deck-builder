Game rules for now:

* Each player starts the game with 5 cards in hand. Every 15 seconds both players draw a card if they are able to. 
* If a player has more than 7 cards in their hand, the game will randomly discard cards in hand until it goes back to 7.
* Unless stated otherwise, all spells, traps, and effects 5(will play around with this value) seconds to activate to allow for responses.
* Monsters that are summoned will have summoning sickness of 5 seconds unless stated otherwise.
* Both players start the game with 40 life(i have no idea what is a good number tbh, yugioh likes big numbers in thousands, magic is like lower numbers) 
* When a player's life points reach zero, they lose the game(potential fear and hunger coinflip addition?)
* When a player can not draw a card, they lose the game(also potential fear and hunger coin flip even ? )
* Trap cards are activated automatically based on when a certain condition is met(during the heat of battle, it would be unreasonable to manually activate and target effects of traps)
* Spells can be skillshots (aim a projectile that takes control of an enemy monster)
* Similar to yugioh arc-v, there will be action cards periodically spawning in the field to encourage movement. 
* Field spells change the terrain of the map most of the time. 
* Monsters unless stated otherwise are sent to the players graveyard. 
* Unless stated otherwise, spawning monsters have a cooldown. The cooldown depends on the level(for now is dependant on the level of the monster, eg. level 1 monster gives you a 1 second cool down. level 10 monster gives you a 10 second cool down until you can spawn your next monster). 
* Monsters can be banished
* Unless stated otherwise, monsters can not attack directly if there is another monster on the field. Their AI will target other monsters for attacks when favorable, and if not will try to evade battle. Monsters on the offensive will eventually reach their target given enough time via compounding speed bonus for being on the offensive(so a monster cant just run away forever)
* Spells that are not skillshots( such as effect damage) will also reach their intended target unless interrupted, whereas skill shot spells can miss their targets. 
* At the moment, I haven't fully decided on if monsters will be have like heartstone with their attack and health being persistant, or like magic , or like yugioh where only attack matters if they are in attack position. I think I will go with maybe yugioh system for simplicity but I think the heartstone system could yield more interesting glass canon type of cards.
